This repository contains the material for the 'Data Wrangling' workshop given as
part of the McGill initiative in Computational Medicine's winter 2021 workshop
series. The content is summarized as follows, listed by folder:

- `docs` : Workshop PDF handout, containing hands-on lecture material with
           inline code. Generated by exporting org-mode plaintext to `LaTeX` via
           `pdflatex`.

- `src`  : R and Julia source code.

- `data` : Input datasets ingested by the code in `src`.

    - `data/HumanGeneLocations.tsv`: human gene information taken from the UCSC
      Genome Browser. Chromosome location; transcription start & end sites; gene
      name.

    - `data/HumanGeneProbeLocations.csv`: human gene probe location information
      (Affymetrix GeneChips) for use in DNA microarray gene expression
      experiments. Probe name, target gene, chromosome location, (start) site 1,
      (stop) site 2.

- `out`  : Output data; generated by executing the code in `src` on the input
           data in `data`.
